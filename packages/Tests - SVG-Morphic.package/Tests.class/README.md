If there is no reference to Stroke of Fill in the name of the example morphs, then it means they are transparent/have no color. I might forget to implement it in some places, so feel free to  implement it after the fact. 
I also generated the svg data manually and randomly without having much in the way of experience with SVG and also not being a Squeak expert. That may iduce some mistakes, so if you are certain  you found something better, feel free to change them.
